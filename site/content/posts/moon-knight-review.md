After seeing Ex Machina (2014), I've really liked Oscar Isaac in every role I've seen him in.

Moon Knight (season 1) is a humorous superhero adventure. It presents a world where the Egyptian gods and their mythology is literally real (the same way as Asgard was in Thor) and presents a psychologically loaded origin story for the antihero Moon Knight.

Certainly entertaining throughout the 6 episode runtime. Ethan Hawke was also great as the charismatic cult leader Arthur Harrow.
