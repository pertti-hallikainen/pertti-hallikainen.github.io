## The 2024 Spring Matriculation Math Exam had a oopsie
The advanced mathematics examination (also known as The Long Math) had a mistake in it; problem 5 had no valid solutions. The problem featured a grid of numbers, where each number was supposed to be the average of those directly next to it. The challenge was to form a group of equations and solve for x and y, a rather common task, except this time no numbers x and y existed that would satisfy the given conditions. Many students were left confounded.

The problem and sample solution can be found [here](https://files.mafy.fi/Yo-mallivastaukset/2024K/pmyo_k24.pdf#section*.6).

## How do these mistakes even happen?
The Matriculation Examination Board [apologized](https://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/art-2000010308578.html) for the mistake. It's still a little curious how these mishaps are even possible. I would expect the exam to be tested by at least two people. If there are sudden changes at the last minute, I would still expect someone to calculate the test problems before they are handed to thousands of students nationwide. Today, these tests are digital. Students are allowed to use calculators and computers with pre-installed software. This would lead me to believe that the examination is designed with these digital tools in mind. Creating an automated test for the exam should be possible. But perhaps it's asking too much. Mistakes happen, to everyone, and it's a valuable lesson to know that they do.

## Repeatedly
Here are a couple more criticisms of the Board from past years that I could find:
- [Why does the history exam distort the history of Israel?](https://www.seurakuntalainen.fi/blogit/miksi-syksyn-ylioppilaskoe-vaaristelee-israelin-historiaa/)
- [Why is right-wing Breitbart News used as a source in English exam?](https://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/art-2000005364174.html)
- [Forest ecologist criticises biology exam for errors of fact](https://yle.fi/a/3-12384203)

While the students are asked to analyze given materials and support their findings and viewpoint, I think the materials should either be capital C-orrect, or then they should be misleading, ambiguous or controversial on purpose. I think they already do this pretty well. Maybe I should do a proper review of the exams to see what they are like these days.

I wouldn't mind if they included one impossible problem in the exam every now and then, if the joke was you would only score points if you could correctly prove it was impossible.
