## Municipal elections 13.4.2025

I am a candidate in the municipal elections because I don't only want to complain about how things are, I also want to take action to improve them. Being a candidate is a natural way to participate in democratic decision-making. I value community, hold a worldview that I would describe as scientific and enjoy the company of my loved ones and the stories that we tell each other, which affect the world around us for generations to come. I am a candidate for [Tampereen Vihreät](https://www.tampereenvihreat.fi/embed/kuntavaalit24/?kieli=fi&vaali=kuntavaalit-2025), the Green Party.

In municipal politics it is possible to succeed if you are able to read and listen. If you want to achieve more, it would be useful to be able to inspire and negotiate. And those good values people talk so much about, they don't hurt to have.

I will write on this page all things relevant to my campaign and I will link to the voting aid applications I answer. I appreciate transparency in politics and want to meet the voters' needs for information, during and after the election.

If you want to ask my opinion on a specific issue, you can contact me on Instagram or through e-mail. You can find my social links and contact information at the bottom of the page.





# Election Themes

### 1. If climate emergency is not declared nationwide, we can do it locally

Municipal citizens have the right to know that the city is led by people who take climate change seriously. The current [climate strategy paper](https://www.tampere.fi/en/nature-and-environment/climate-action-tampere/climate-neutral-tampere-2030) expires in 2030. We need to achieve the goals of the current strategy and begin planning for the next one. The goal should be to first become carbon neutral and then carbon negative.

Reaching our climate goals in time can not be done through deployment of technological solutions alone. No matter how much we zone for renewable energy, manufacture synthetic and bio fuels and build charging stations for electric vehicles, and possibly look into small modular nuclear power, we must first and foremost reduce consumption and turn to low-emission alternatives in purchases made by the city. At the same time we will continue to develop public transportation, build for high residential density and short distances to services, while protecting the city's forests, lakes and local nature.

### 2. Special focus on schools and the youth

Group sizes in schools, teacher turnover rate and sick leaves, school bullying and learning results must be regularly monitored by the education board. Schools need peace for learning, but also sufficient resources. The city must ensure there are enough teaching assistants, special education teachers, school social workers and psychologists. Additional training for teachers must be available, encouraged and rewarded in pay. Schools should promote and further develop democracy education and anti-racism education.

### 3. Safety requires work and action from all of us

Employment brings security to individuals and thus to all residents. When the employment and economic development services (TE-services) are transferred from the state to the city, we must seize the opportunity and usher the expertise of our TE-workers, find new routes of open-minded co-operation and new opportunities and work for our over 23000 unemployed people. Work should not be a privilege, and it should not be as cumbersome to mold a career path for yourself, be it part-time, temporary or whether in the public, private or the third sector. To improve work-life balance and share work evenly, the city could offer a 4-day work week for workers where applicable.

Safety is also created by functional social and health services, substance abuse services and prevention of homelessness. Tampere should increase the capacity of shelters for victims of domestic abuse. For the county election, I recommend you check out [the candidates set by Pirkanmaan Vihreät](https://www.pirkanmaanvihreat.fi/embed/aluevaalit-ehdokkaat/?kieli=fi&vaali=aluevaalit-2025&alue=pirkanmaa).
