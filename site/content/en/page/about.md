## Greetings

My name is Pertti. My family occasionally calls me Pepe.

- I'm 34 years old. I live in Tampere, Finland.
- I used to work as a software developer. Right now I'm unemployed.
- I've got a master's degree in physics.
- I won the 1st place trophy from a Magic the Gathering pre-release event in Helsinki back in 2018. I enjoy strategy games and card games.
- I've done volunteer work for the Finnish Red Cross, teaching Finnish to immigrants.
- I'm very much interested in game theory, system theory and related topics, for example when applied to the study of climate change politics. I'm widely interested in philosophy, sociology and economics. I'm also interested in matters related to seeing, noticing and being seen, empathy and stuff like that.


If there's anything else you would like to know about me, I'm your guy to ask. You can find my contact information & social links at the bottom of the page.


## Professional history

- I've been unemployed since 2022. I've found it important to focus on myself and my family, and I've had a wonderful time. I've got a couple creative projects that I'm hoping to finish some day; an unfinished novel and some ideas for an adventure game.
- Between 2016-2022 I worked for the Finnish bureau of Statistics (Statistics Finland for short). I was an "Application Specialist", basically a software engineer. I did coding for the software used in statistics production, for example the business register.
- Before that, between 2009-2015, I studied physics at the University of Jyv채skyl채. I graduated with a master's degree in 2015, with minors in mathematics and computer science.


## Political views

I've been a member of the Finnish Green Party since 2011. I was a candidate in the 2012 municipal election in Jyv채skyl채. When I moved to Helsinki for work in 2016 (for the years that then became the Trump presidency, Covid and the Russian invasion of Ukraine), I did not participate in Helsinki-local politics. This was one thing that caused me stress during those years, although I did not quite understand the extent of the problem back then. I didn't do enough to find a community for myself. Unemployment has been privileged time for me, it has allowed me time and energy to realign my priorities and strengthened by ability to act on them accordingly. Now, I am a candidate for the Tampere Greens in the 2025 municipal election.

My political views are left leaning, with a strong interest towards softening the transition from a fossil fuel powered economy towards a sustainable society based on more responsible consumption of natural resources and powered by clean, renewable energy. Tampere is an excellent city for families both with or without children, welcoming to refugees and immigrants and safe for everyone. The city is going to continue seeing some of the fastest growth in all of Finland. Managing this growth in a manner that is both environmentally and socially responsible is going to be the biggest challenge the new city council will face in the immediate future.

On this site I am going to write about local politics and highlight some stories from further away. If you find any of these topics interesting, I hope you take the address for later use. Writing is purposeful.
