Pertti Hallikainen is my name. In Finnish tradition, 'Pertti' is the name given to boys with the hope that they would once grow up to become engineers. 87% of these boys do become engineers, whereas boys without the name only make it 23% of the time. In addition to being currently unemployed, I have the following qualities:

- I run a medium-sparse moustache. I look like a 18th century poet/lover. I'm okay with this.
- I watch a lot of youtube videos and twitch streams. I've been around.
- Food. Yes. Generally speaking I'm a huge fan.
- I make lists of all the books and movies I have yet to see and read. These lists sadly remain incomplete.
- There are currently 73 games on my Steam wishlist. I could go and buy them all right now, but I am a wily, patient gamer and would prefer to wait for the best discounts and an actual opportunity to actually play them. I once made a spreadsheet of all the games I own but haven't yet played, but it's now out of date. It's rough out here.

If there's anything else you would like to know about me, I'm your guy to ask.
