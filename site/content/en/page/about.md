## 

- My name is Pertti.
- I'm 34 years old and I live in Tampere, Finland.
- I've got a master's degree in physics. I was good at it and wanted to know how the world works.
- I used to work as a software developer, but now I'm unemployed.
- In my free time I play video games, although recently I've been too busy to play much.
- I volunteer for the Finnish Red Cross, teaching Finnish to immigrants.
- I'm interested in philosophy, social sciences and literature.


## Professional history

- Between 2009-2015, I studied physics at the University of Jyv채skyl채. I graduated with a master's degree in 2015, with minors in mathematics and computer science.
- Between 2016-2022 I worked for the Finnish bureau of Statistics. I did coding for the business register and other applications used within the office.
- I've been unemployed since 2022. I've had more time to focus on my health and my family, and it's been wonderful. I've got an outline for a novel that I'm hoping to get to writing soon.


## Political views

I've been a member of the Finnish Green Party since 2011. I was a candidate in the 2012 municipal election in Jyv채skyl채, where I received 14 votes. When I moved to Helsinki for work in 2016, for the years that then became the Trump presidency, Covid pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, I did not participate in politics. I eventually got tired and unhappy at work. In 2025 I was a candidate for the Tampere Greens in the municipal election, and received 17 votes.

My political views are left leaning. I want society to transition from the current fossil fuel powered economy towards a sustainable society, based on more responsible consumption of natural resources and powered by clean, renewable energy. 

Tampere is arguably the best city in Finland, excellent for families both with or without children, welcoming to refugees and immigrants and safe for everyone. The city is going to keep growing; managing this growth in a responsible manner is going to be the new city council's biggest challenge.

In my blog I am going to write about local politics and more broadly on the world.
