***Archived from the 13.4.2025 municipal election.***

I am a candidate in the municipal elections because I don't only want to complain about how things are, I also want to take action to improve them. Being a candidate is a natural way to participate in democratic decision-making. I value community, hold a worldview that I would describe as scientific and enjoy the company of my loved ones and the stories we tell each other. I am a candidate for [Tampereen Vihreät](https://www.tampereenvihreat.fi/kuntavaalit25/?kieli=en&vaali=kuntavaalit-2025&kunta=k837&ehdokas=hallikainen-pertti-7283), the Green Party.

If you are unfamiliar with the Finnish Green Party, you can find the best summary of who we are from our [political programme.](https://www.greens.fi/political-programme-of-the-greens-2023-2027/)

Municipal politics is a bit of a weird sport. I'm hoping the representatives who get elected into the city council are reasonable people, with whom it is possible to co-operate to develop the city in a healthy direction. Our decision-making process should be robust in such a way that people can trust their taxes are spent responsibly and that the city provides it's services at sufficient quantity and quality.

If there is a specific issue you want to know my opinion on, you can contact me with the social links at the bottom of the page.


### Campaign Promises
1. I promise to reduce the city's carbondioxide emissions in accordance with the carbon neutral Tampere 2030 roadmap.
2. I promise to maintain and improve learning conditions in schools, for example by setting maximum group sizes and sufficient teacher resources.
3. I promise to promote openness in municipal politics by sharing my opinion well in advance and writing about current proceedings of the city council on my webpage.

## Election Themes

### 1. If climate emergency is not declared nationwide, we can do it locally

Municipal citizens have the right to know that the city is led by people who take climate change seriously. The current [climate strategy paper](https://www.tampere.fi/en/nature-and-environment/climate-action-tampere/climate-neutral-tampere-2030) expires in 2030. We need to achieve the goals of the current strategy and begin planning for the next one. The goal should be to first become carbon neutral and then carbon negative.

Reaching our climate goals in time can not be done through deployment of technological solutions alone. No matter how much we zone for renewable energy, manufacture synthetic and bio fuels and build charging stations for electric vehicles, and possibly look into small modular nuclear power, we must first and foremost reduce consumption and turn to low-emission alternatives in purchases made by the city. At the same time we will continue to develop public transportation, build for high residential density and short distances to services, while protecting the city's forests, lakes and local nature.

I've written more on climate change [here.](/posts/thoughts-on-climate-change/)

### 2. Special focus on schools and the youth

Group sizes in schools, teacher turnover rate and sick leaves, school bullying and learning results must be regularly monitored by the education board. Schools need peace for learning, but also sufficient resources. The city must ensure there are enough teaching assistants, special education teachers, school social workers and psychologists. Additional training for teachers must be available, encouraged and rewarded in pay. Schools should promote and further develop democracy education and anti-racism education.

### 3. Access to work improves social security and urban safety

Employment brings security to individuals and thus to all residents. When the employment and economic development services (TE-services) are transferred from the state to the city, we must seize the opportunity and find work for our over 23000 unemployed people. Work should not be a privilege, and it should not be as cumbersome to mold a career for yourself, be it part-time, temporary or in the public, private or the third sector. To improve work-life balance and share work more evenly, the city should offer a 4-day work week where applicable.

Safety is also created by well working social and health services, substance abuse services and prevention of homelessness. Tampere should increase the capacity of shelters for victims of domestic abuse.
