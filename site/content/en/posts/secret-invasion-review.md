Nick Fury talks to various people, shoots some people, saves the world. A shapeshifting alien race has peacefully infiltrated Earth's highest offices. One alien isn't happy with this and seeks a WWIII level of a violent solution and godlike superpowers. Sure, why not. I just have the feeling they could've made a much more compelling story with these ingredients. Now it was just boring. And disappointing.
