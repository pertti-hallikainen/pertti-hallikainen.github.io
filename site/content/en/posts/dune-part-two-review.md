## The movie is very good
I'm placing this in the same category as the Titanic, Avatar, the original Star Wars trilogy and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The box office numbers may not get quite as high, but this movie was easily up there in quality.

## Fear of missing out
Are you? If you want to see good movies as they come out, yes. If you are interested in the Dune universe and can't be bothered to read the books, yes. But besides that, the biggest overarching theme in the movie is just plain old power politics. Ascension happens through display of power and acts of violence. It's basically Game of Thrones in the sci-fi desert of planet Arrakis.

## Slight observations
The starkly contrasting factions with different gender power dynamics are fun. There's the violently patriarchal Harkonnen, the deceitful matriarchal Bene Gesserit witches and the freedom-fighting Fremen, where all are equal under some traditional notions of honor. All of these factions are meritocratic. Tests of strength, combat proficiency and other virtues are common.

They don't use guns. Apparently this is due to the shield technology, making hand-to-hand sword combat more effective. If you can stomach the reasoning, the on-screen action is clean and flows like a dance. It in part adds to the engaging look & feel of this world. This also has some story consequences, and some scenes will appear silly to the viewer who is expecting the gun to win over the sword.

It is alluring to look for comparisons between spice and oil, the conflict between the Fremen and the Harkonnen to the conflicts going on in the Middle East. I don't think it's necessary. It's okay to enjoy a work of fiction as it is, just as a story. The more interesting thing is how the story is told, what it feels like to immerse yourself in these worlds.

## The videogames
Dune: Spice wars (35€) released out of early access last year. The game enjoys generally positive reviews, but has also been called generic, shallow and boring. I make my purchasing decisions based on these reviews, so I haven't played the game myself yet. Apparently it's kind of a mix between 4X and RTS. I did enjoy the developer's previous game Northgard, so I'll likely end up picking this up at a later date.

Dune Imperium (23€) is a digital version of the Dune board game. Apparently the board game is good, and the digital version is also good. Interested to pick this up when it goes on sale.
