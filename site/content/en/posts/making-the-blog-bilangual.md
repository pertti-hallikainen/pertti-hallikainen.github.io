## Why
I am used to writing in English. I often check word translations, both ways. An English-language blog can theoretically reach a wider readership, assuming that I ever decide to advertise this blog somewhere, in order to get readers. In Finnish, my biggest problem is the comma rules. Sometimes I write sentences where I would prefer to leave the comma out, I taste the rhythm with and without the comma, I try to justify why it should be okay to leave it out. Another problem has to do with expressiveness. English just somehow sounds like a more powerful language to say what I want. There are more synonyms and alternative expressions. I don't know if it's that way for real, but at least that's how I feel about it.

Then I think about people close to me, some of whom cannot read English, at least not as fast as they can read their own mother tongue. I would like them to be able to read the blog too. Some of the topics I want to write about concern only Finnish phenomena, writing about them in English would seem a bit pointless. You have to know your audience, as they say, and take them into account.

## How
Technically, implementing bilingual support on this platform was quite simple. I haven't been able to customize the menu links. This is both a technical detail and a translation difficulty. I couldn't come up with a suitable translation for the words "About" and "Tags". Many Finnish bloggers use their first name, or you could use "info" or something else. It's not fully translated, but whatever, it's "about" good enough.

And then the biggest problem. In terms of time, it can take about half an hour to write one blog post. It depends on how long you want to polish it or do research. After the text is ready, how long does it take to make the translation? Nowadays, translation tools work quite fine. I could throw the text into Google Translate and continue with minor corrections. Or I could refuse these tools and "translate", practically rewriting the text in English. It takes another half an hour. Does that seem worthwhile? What else could I do in that time?

I probably won't translate every blog post. We'll see about that. Anyone who wants to read a foreign language can use those translation tools themselves. Also, I need to time myself so my time estimates are more accurate.
